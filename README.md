# CNN-ABC-PSO
##### [Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) | Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm (ABC) | Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)]

Project developed in IC (InteligÃªncia Computacional) class.

### The first stage of the project
Involves conducting research and implementing an application for analyzing problems in the field of Data Science for one of the following areas using a CNN:
  - Climate Changes;
  - Sustainable Economy;
  - Green Energy.

Chosen Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mostafaabla/garbage-classification/data

### The second stage 
Is to carry out an investigative work in the field of Swarm Intelligence.

Swarm Intelligence algorithm chosen: Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm (ABC).

I also used the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to compare with the ABC algorithm in this second phase.

### The third and final stage
Is the combination of the last two stages.

## Languages/Frameworks/Tools used:
  - Jupiter Notebook;
  - Spyder;
  - Python;
  - Anaconda-Navigator.
